# VendingMachineApp

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 10.1.4.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).

State Management
-----------------
 The state management can be implemented by using a shared service having a shared state/data. I have used InventoryService for storing the current inventory stock.
 State can be managed through componentâ€™s interaction via input bindings and output event emitters. The child components Purchase and Resupply will emit the stock balance as @Output customs events to the parent Vendor-Machine-Accept component.
 We can use other libraries like RxJs for managing the state but the shared service approach will be enough for a simple application like this.

 SASS Styling
 ------------------------------------
 For SASS styling, I have used bootstrap sass which is in "../node_modules/bootstrap/scss/bootstrap.scss"

Run the below command in the project root directory.
npm install --save bootstrap
Now add Bootstrap to the angular.json config inside the styles array (before any other custom css/scss files in order to let them override bootstrap rules :

"styles": [
  "node_modules/bootstrap/scss/bootstrap.scss",
  /* ... */
],
